# Cooking-Blog

This project contains a simple cooking blog with three pages, designed entirely with HTML and CSS. Some of the typical elements of a blog cannot be recreated with just HTML and CSS (for instance, creating blog posts without editing source code) so the project is intended to be a baseline for a future design that uses JavaScript.
